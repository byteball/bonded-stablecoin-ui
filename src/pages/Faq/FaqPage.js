              It’s not zero-sum (assuming the peg holds). In the bonding curve that is used to issue the
              tokens, the total value of the tokens is greater than the value of
              the reserve that was initially invested to create them. So, yes, it
              is possible for each group to win in terms of the value of their
              assets while the system grows, and not at the expense of the other group.

            <p>
              No. It runs on a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based distributed
              ledger.
            </p>
            <p>
              A blockchain would be significantly less suitable for a stablecoin
              like this because blockchains have blocks and miners. Miners would
              be able to manipulate the order of transactions within a block in
              order to place their own transaction before yours so that you
              receive a worse price when buying from a bonding curve or selling to
              it. Even non-miners can affect the order of transactions within a
              block by offering a slightly higher fee to a miner (which works like
              a bribe). This could expose users to significant uncertainty, risks,
              and losses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bonded stablecoins run on <a href="https://obyte.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obyte</a> — a blockless minerless DAG
              ledger. In a DAG these tricks don’t work. There are no miners, no
              blocks, the positions of transactions in the DAG cannot be changed
              by anybody, and it is impossible for any single actor to manipulate
              the order of transactions.

          <Trans i18nKey="faq.questions.7.answer">
            <p>
              The price of IUSD is “attracted” to the target (benchmark) with the
              help of a so-called capacitor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every purchase of IUSD from the bonding curve and every sale
              to the bonding curve affect the IUSD price. If a transaction pushes
              the price away from the target, it is “punished” with a fee, the
              farther away from the target, the more the fee. The collected fees
              get accumulated in a capacitor. Every transaction that corrects the
              price back to the target, is rewarded using the funds accumulated in
              the capacitor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, the stability fund buys or sells the other token — GRDV2 — in order to correct the price back to the peg. When and how much the fund buys or sells, is determined by an algorithm that can be changed only by governance decision of SFUSD holders.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to that, traders who anticipate that the fund would eventually correct the price, can profit from buying or selling IUSD before the fund intervenes. Their trades move the price closer to the peg and might make the fund's intervention unnecessary.

              This is new unproven technology and might not work as expected.
              Although we did our best to avoid errors while implementing the
              system and to analyze the incentives of different user groups, both
              technical bugs and wrong conclusions about user behavior in some
              circumstances cannot be excluded. Nothing like this has been done
              before and we unfortunately couldn’t gain much from the experience
              of the predecessors.

            <p>
              One can earn interest with bonded stablecoins. When OUSD stablecoins are not used, one can "stake" them by converting to IUSD whose target price constantly grows. After some time, one can convert IUSD back to OUSD and get more OUSD in exchange, which reflects the interest earned while OUSD was staked.

          <h2>{t("faq.questions.11.question", "Can I trade with leverage?")}</h2>

            <p>
              Yes. You’ll need to create a leveraged stablecoin or use one that
              somebody else has already created.
            </p>
            <p>
              A leveraged stablecoin is a synthetic coin that tracks the price of
              an asset to the power of 2 (for 2x leverage), 3 (for 3x leverage),
              -1 (for a short position), -2 (for a 2x leveraged short position),
              and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, while Brent Crude is worth $40, a 2x leverage
              stablecoin BRENT2/USD is worth 1600. If Brent goes up 25% to $50,
              BRENT2/USD goes up to 2500 — a 56.25% gain.
            </p>
            <p>
              It might seem unusual to call such coins “stablecoins” but they are
              stable relative to an artificial “price” such as Brent squared.
              Everything is relative after all, including stability.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you{" "}
              <a href="create">
                create a new stablecoin
              </a>
              , you need to specify the desired leverage parameter. It is 0 by
              default which for GBYTE/USD price feed means track USD price.
              Leverage 1 would mean plain long position in GBYTE (which is
              equivalent to just holding the reserve currency GBYTE), leverage 2
              would mean 2x leveraged position in GBYTE vs USD, leverage 3 —
              3x long position in GBYTE, leverage -1 — short position in
              GBYTE, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that with this kind of leverage, you can’t be margin called and
              liquidated.

            <p>In v2 stablecoins, they are used to automatically keep the price near the peg as much as possible. </p>
