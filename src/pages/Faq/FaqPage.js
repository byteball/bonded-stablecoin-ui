            You can buy IUSD first, then open a <a href="trade/26XAPPPTTYRIOSYNCUV3NS2H57X5LZLJ#deposits">deposit</a> to receive the
            equivalent amount of OUSD. While the deposit is open, you can also
            periodically withdraw the accrued interest (16% p.a.) or choose a
            charity or your friend or relative who will receive the interest.
            When you don’t need OUSD any more, you can close the deposit,
            receive your IUSD back, then sell IUSD.

          <p>
            Probably it did not have enough protection. A deposit with the smallest protection can be closed by anybody by sending the required amount of OUSD. You don't lose anything when your deposit is closed as you have already received your OUSD but you stop receiving interest. To protect your deposit from closing, you need to add some GBYTE to the deposit on the <a href="trade/26XAPPPTTYRIOSYNCUV3NS2H57X5LZLJ#deposits">deposits page</a>.

            It’s not zero-sum. In the bonding curve that is used to issue the
            tokens, the total value of the tokens is greater than the value of
            the reserve that was initially invested to create them. So, yes, it
            is possible for each group to win in terms of the value of their
            assets, and not at the expense of the other group.

          <p>
            No. It runs on a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based distributed
            ledger.
          </p>
          <p>
            A blockchain would be significantly less suitable for a stablecoin
            like this because blockchains have blocks and miners. Miners would
            be able to manipulate the order of transactions within a block in
            order to place their own transaction before yours so that you
            receive a worse price when buying from a bonding curve or selling to
            it. Even non-miners can affect the order of transactions within a
            block by offering a slightly higher fee to a miner (which works like
            a bribe). This could expose users to significant uncertainty, risks,
            and losses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bonded stablecoins run on <a href="https://obyte.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obyte</a> &mdash; a blockless minerless DAG
            ledger. In a DAG these tricks don’t work. There are no miners, no
            blocks, the positions of transactions in the DAG cannot be changed
            by anybody, and it is impossible for any single actor to manipulate
            the order of transactions.

          <p>
            The price of IUSD is “attracted” to the target (benchmark) with the
            help of a so-called capacitor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every purchase of IUSD or GRD from the bonding curve and every sale
            to the bonding curve affect the IUSD price. If a transaction pushes
            the price away from the target, it is “punished” with a fee, the
            farther away from the target, the more the fee. The collected fees
            get accumulated in a capacitor. Every transaction that corrects the
            price back to the target, is rewarded using the funds accumulated in
            the capacitor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the type of the bonding curve chosen, it is the holders of
            GRD who are the first to react to any deviations of the price from
            the target and correct them. For example, when too many people buy
            IUSD, they pull the price of IUSD below the peg (because IUSD
            token’s power in the curve formula is ½, i.e. less than 1, hence its
            partial derivative has negative power). There are two ways to
            correct the deviation: sell IUSD back to the curve, which is not a
            good idea because its price is currently below the fair price; or
            buy more GRD tokens. By buying more GRD tokens, traders push GRD
            price up (because the power in the curve formula is 2, i.e. more
            than 1, hence its partial derivative has positive power), therefore
            one who buys earlier gets a better price and traders rush to be the
            first to buy while the price is still below equilibrium.

            This is new unproven technology and might not work as expected.
            Although we did our best to avoid errors while implementing the
            system and to analyze the incentives of different user groups, both
            technical bugs and wrong conclusions about user behavior in some
            circumstances cannot be excluded. Nothing like this has been done
            before and we unfortunately couldn’t gain much from the experience

            One can earn interest with bonded stablecoins. One can get IUSD,
            immediately put it on a deposit, get OUSD in exchange, use it for
            payments in a stable currency while interest payments accumulate,
            and withdraw interest from time to time.
          </p>
          <p>
            One can also redirect interest to a good cause, e.g. to a charity.

          <ul>

              - bonded stablecoins do not expire any more, they are perpetual.

            <li>
              - OUSD is truly stable, there is no appreciation, it targets the
              familiar and well-established unit of account, USD.
            </li>
            <li>
              - there are no auctions any more and users don’t need to look
              after their loans and refill collateral or risk losing their
              collateral when its price falls abruptly.
            </li>
            <li>
              - there is no overcollateralization any more, which was commonly
              misunderstood.
            </li>
            <li>
              - there is no need to balance risks against the amount of capital
              wasted in excess collateral.

          <p>
            Yes. You’ll need to create a leveraged stablecoin or use one that
            somebody else has already created.
          </p>
          <p>
            A leveraged stablecoin is a synthetic coin that tracks the price of
            an asset to the power of 2 (for 2x leverage), 3 (for 3x leverage),
            -1 (for a short position), -2 (for a 2x leveraged short position),
            and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, while Brent Crude is worth $40, a 2x leverage
            stablecoin BRENT2/USD is worth 1600. If Brent goes up 25% to $50,
            BRENT2/USD goes up to 2500 &mdash; a 56.25% gain.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might seem unusual to call such coins “stablecoins” but they are
            stable relative to an artificial “price” such as Brent squared.
            Everything is relative after all, including stability.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you{" "}
            <a href="create">
              create a new stablecoin
            </a>
            , you need to specify the desired leverage parameter. It is 0 by
            default which for GBYTE/USD price feed means track USD price.
            Leverage 1 would mean plain long position in GBYTE (which is
            equivalent to just holding the reserve currency GBYTE), leverage 2
            would mean 2x leveraged position in GBYTE vs USD, leverage 3 &mdash;
            3x long position in GBYTE, leverage -1 &mdash; short position in
            GBYTE, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that with this kind of leverage, you can’t be margin called and
            liquidated.
