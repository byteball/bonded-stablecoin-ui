        "question": "Who operates the minting of all these tokens?",

      },
      "5": {
        "question": "IUSDV2 constantly grows thanks to interest. Assuming this attracts new users, SFUSD should grow too and both token holders win, who loses then?",
        "answer": "<0>It’s not zero-sum. In the bonding curve that is used to issue the tokens, the total value of the tokens is greater than the value of the reserve that was initially invested to create them. So, yes, it is possible for each group to win in terms of the value of their assets, and not at the expense of the other group.</0>"
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "Does this system run on a blockchain?",
        "answer": "<0>No. It runs on a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based distributed ledger.</0><1>A blockchain would be significantly less suitable for a stablecoin like this because blockchains have blocks and miners. Miners would be able to manipulate the order of transactions within a block in order to place their own transaction before yours so that you receive a worse price when buying from a bonding curve or selling to it. Even non-miners can affect the order of transactions within a block by offering a slightly higher fee to a miner (which works like a bribe). This could expose users to significant uncertainty, risks, and losses.</1><2>Bonded stablecoins run on <1>Obyte</1> — a blockless minerless DAG ledger. In a DAG these tricks don’t work. There are no miners, no blocks, the positions of transactions in the DAG cannot be changed by anybody, and it is impossible for any single actor to manipulate the order of transactions.</2>"
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "What makes stablecoins pegged to their benchmark?",
        "answer": "<0>The price of IUSDV2 is “attracted” to the target (benchmark) with the help of a so-called capacitor.</0><1>Every purchase of IUSDV2 from the bonding curve and every sale to the bonding curve affect the IUSDV2 price. If a transaction pushes the price away from the target, it is “punished” with a fee, the farther away from the target, the more the fee. The collected fees get accumulated in a capacitor. Every transaction that corrects the price back to the target, is rewarded using the funds accumulated in the capacitor.</1><2>Also, the stability fund buys or sells the other token — GRDV2 — in order to correct the price back to the peg. When and how much the fund buys or sells, is determined by an algorithm that can be changed only by governance decision of SFUSD holders.</2><3>In addition to that, traders who anticipate that the fund would eventually correct the price, can profit from buying or selling IUSDV2 before the fund intervenes. Their trades move the price closer to the peg and might make the fund's intervention unnecessary.</3><4>Read the <1>blog article introducing bonded stablecoins</1> and <3>updates introduced in version 2 stablecoins</3> for more details.</4>"

      "8": {
        "question": "What are the risks?",
        "answer": "<0>This is new unproven technology and might not work as expected. Although we did our best to avoid errors while implementing the system and to analyze the incentives of different user groups, both technical bugs and wrong conclusions about user behavior in some circumstances cannot be excluded. Nothing like this has been done before and we unfortunately couldn’t gain much from the experience of the predecessors.</0>"
      },
      "9": {
        "question": "How are bonded stablecoins different from DAI, USDT, USDC, etc?",
        "answer": "<0>One can earn interest with bonded stablecoins. When OUSDV2 stablecoins are not used, one can \"stake\" them by converting to IUSDV2 whose target price constantly grows. After some time, one can convert IUSDV2 back to OUSDV2 and get more OUSDV2 in exchange, which reflects the interest earned while OUSDV2 was staked.</0>"
      },
      "10": {
        "question": "How do bonded stablecoins compare against discount stablecoins?",
        "answer": "<0>Bonded stablecoins is our next generation stablecoin design and it improves above <1>discount stablecoins</1> in virtually all dimensions. In particular:</0><1><0>- bonded stablecoins do not expire any more, they are perpetual.</0><1>- OUSDV2 is truly stable, there is no appreciation, it targets the familiar and well-established unit of account, USD.</1><2>- there are no auctions any more and users don’t need to look after their loans and refill collateral or risk losing their collateral when its price falls abruptly.</2><3>- there is no overcollateralization any more, which was commonly misunderstood.</3><4>- there is no need to balance risks against the amount of capital wasted in excess collateral.</4></1>"
      },
      "11": {
        "question": "Can I trade with leverage?",
        "answer": "<0>Yes. You’ll need to create a leveraged stablecoin or use one that somebody else has already created.</0><1>A leveraged stablecoin is a synthetic coin that tracks the price of an asset to the power of 2 (for 2x leverage), 3 (for 3x leverage), -1 (for a short position), -2 (for a 2x leveraged short position), and so on.</1><2>For example, while Brent Crude is worth $40, a 2x leverage stablecoin BRENT2/USD is worth 1600. If Brent goes up 25% to $50, BRENT2/USD goes up to 2500 — a 56.25% gain.</2><3>It might seem unusual to call such coins “stablecoins” but they are stable relative to an artificial “price” such as Brent squared. Everything is relative after all, including stability.</3><4>When you <2>create a new stablecoin</2>, you need to specify the desired leverage parameter. It is 0 by default which for GBYTE/USD price feed means track USD price. Leverage 1 would mean plain long position in GBYTE (which is equivalent to just holding the reserve currency GBYTE), leverage 2 would mean 2x leveraged position in GBYTE vs USD, leverage 3 — 3x long position in GBYTE, leverage -1 — short position in GBYTE, and so on.</4><5>Note that with this kind of leverage, you can’t be margin called and liquidated.</5><6>For details, see <1>our blog introducing bonded stablecoins</1> .</6>"

You have to be a developer though. There are sources of <1>example oracle</1> to help you get started.

        "question": "What is the Stability Fund and Decision Engine?",
        "answer": "<0>In v2 stablecoins, they are used to automatically keep the price near the peg. </0><1>The Decision Engine (DE) is an Autonomous Agent that uses the funds in the Stability Fund to correct the price by buying or selling growth tokens. The Stability Fund is another AA that just holds all growth tokens and assets in the reserve currency contributed by investors. The investors get shares of the fund in exchange.</1><2>Since the fund holds growth tokens as part of its assets, and they appreciate as more interest (stable+) tokens are issued, buying shares of the fund is a way to bet on growth of the companion stablecoin.</2><3>The DE can be replaced by governance to optimize its behavior to both better keep the peg and generate greater shareholder value.</3>"

    "curve": "<0>That is, in order to issue more GRDV2 or IUSDV2 tokens, one needs to lock some reserve in GBYTE, and when one wants to redeem GRDV2 or IUSDV2, they get a share of the reserve back. The prices of GRDV2 and IUSDV2, i.e. how much reserve one needs to pay per token, or can get back per token, depend on the current supplies of the tokens.</0><1>The price of token1 (GRDV2) is <1><0>p</0><1>1</1> =  <3>2</3> <5>s</5><6>1</6> <8>s</8><9>2</9><10>2</10></1></1><2>The price of token2 (IUSDV2) is <1><0>p</0><1>2</1> = <3>2</3> <5>s</5><6>1</6><7>2</7> <9>s</9><10>2</10></1></2><3>The stability mechanisms are designed to keep the price <1>p</1><2>2</2> of IUSDV2 near its target price which is 1 USD plus interest accrued since inception. The target price is known from GBYTE/USD price reported by an oracle that feeds data from cryptocurrency exchanges and the time elapsed since the stablecoin was launched.</3>",
    "mechanisms": "There are 3 mechanisms that keep the price near the target:",
    "title_capacitor": "1. The capacitor",
    "capacitor": "Whenever someone wants to buy or sell IUSDV2 such that this transaction would push the IUSDV2 price away from the target, they have to pay a fee. The farther away from the target, the larger the fee gets. The fees get accumulated in a special reserve which is called a capacitor. Whenever someone pushes the price closer to the target, they get a reward, which is paid from the capacitor. This way, the capacitor incentivizes the trades that correct the price, and disincentivizes the trades that push the price away from the target.",
    "title_fund": "2. Stability Fund",
    "fund": "The fund holds the entire supply of GRDV2 and some amount of the reserve currency GBYTE that was contributed by investors. The fund is algorithmically managed by an Autonomous Agent called <1>Decision Engine</1>, which can use the fund’s GBYTE and GRDV2 to buy or redeem GRDV2 in order to change its supply <3>s</3><4>1</4> and thus change the price <6>p</6><7>2</7> back to the target. Investors buy shares SFUSD in the fund by contributing GBYTE into its reserves. They do so anticipating that the shares would appreciate thanks to the growth of IUSDV2 issuance which raises the worth of the fund’s GRDV2 holdings.",
    "title_trader": "3. Trader Incentives",
    "trader_incentives": "Knowing that the Stability Fund would eventually intervene and correct the price back to the target, traders can make a profit by buying or selling before the Fund. For example, they can buy IUSDV2 when it trades below the target anticipating that the price will soon rise to the target and they’ll have an opportunity to sell higher. By buying or selling before the Fund, they move the price to the target and make the Fund’s intervention unnecessary.",
